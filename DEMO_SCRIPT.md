# SignalDesk Demo Script (2–3 minutes)

## 0:00–0:20 — Problem framing
"Operators drown in fragmented context. SignalDesk turns raw links/notes into decisions and execution packets."

## 0:20–0:55 — Intake
1. Paste mixed inputs into Intake Layer (URL + note + transcript line).
2. Call out auto classification badges and invalid URL detection.
3. Save session with `Cmd/Ctrl + S`.

## 0:55–1:30 — Intelligence + decisions
1. Show Intel Engine columns (opportunity/risk/assumption/unknown).
2. Highlight confidence buckets and numeric confidence score.
3. Move to Decision Layer and explain ranking + rationale.
4. Show 24h/7d/30d roadmap owner + success metrics.

## 1:30–2:20 — Execution handoff
1. Open Execution Packets panel.
2. Pick role (e.g., Coder) and show acceptance criteria/dependencies/risks/handoff prompt.
3. Export role packet markdown and full JSON pack.

## 2:20–2:45 — Close
"SignalDesk doesn’t stop at summaries. It gives a decision stack and role-ready execution packets so teams can move immediately."
